### ## 1. Quantitative Data (Numerical)

This type of data measures quantities and is expressed numerically. It's countable or measurable, and you can perform mathematical operations on it (like averaging).

- **Definition:** Data that deals with numbers and things you can measure objectively.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Height of a person (175 cm)
        
    - Number of students in a class (50)
        
    - Temperature (32Â°C)

### ## 2. Qualitative Data (Categorical)

This type of data describes qualities or characteristics. It's observed, not measured, and is expressed in categories or labels.

- **Definition:** Data that deals with descriptions, labels, and qualities.
    
- **Examples:**
    
    - Eye color (`Blue`, `Brown`, `Green`)
        
    - Economic status (`Poor`, `Middle-Class`, `Rich`)

### ## 3. The Ambiguous Case: When Numbers Represent Quality

This is a critical distinction and a common point of confusion.

> **Example:** "Rate a restaurant on a scale of 1 to 5."

At first glance, this looks quantitative because it uses numbers. However, the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` are just labels for quality levels like `Poor, Average, Good, Very Good, Excellent`. You can't say that a rating of '4' is mathematically twice as good as a '2'.

This type of data is a specific subtype of qualitative data called **Ordinal Data**.

- **Ordinal Data:** Categorical data where the order matters. The intervals between the values are not necessarily equal. (e.g., ratings, education levels `High School, Bachelor's, Master's`).
    
- **Nominal Data:** Categorical data where the order does not matter. (e.g., `Dhaka, Khulna, London`, `Male, Female`).

### ## Summary & Key Questions

**Summary:** Quantitative data is about **measurable numbers**, while Qualitative data is about **descriptive labels**. Numbers can sometimes be used as labels for qualitative data, especially when order matters (Ordinal Data).

**Key Questions:**

- How does this data type affect my choice of a machine learning model?
    
- What is the best way to visualize Ordinal data versus true Quantitative data? (e.g., bar chart vs. histogram).
    
- When might it be acceptable to treat ordinal data (like ratings) as quantitative, and what are the risks?
