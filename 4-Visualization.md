Imagine you work for a popular e-commerce site like Daraz. You create a histogram for the "price of items sold." You see a huge pile of bars on the left for items between 100-1000 BDT, and a long, low tail stretching out to the right for a few items that cost 50,000 BDT or more.

Based on that description, is the data for item prices **right-skewed** or **left-skewed**?

Right-skewed.

**Histogram & Skewness:**

- A **histogram** shows the shape (distribution) of your numerical data.
- **Normal Distribution** is a symmetrical "bell curve" ðŸ”” where Mean = Median.
- **Skewness** is when the data is lopsided. The skew is named after the **long tail**.
- - **Right-Skewed:** Long tail on the right (e.g., income data). **Mean > Median**.
    
- **Left-Skewed:** Long tail on the left (e.g., scores on an easy test). **Mean < Median**.


**Box Plot:**
- Gives a 5-number summary: Min, Max, Median, Q1, and Q3.
- The **box** is the middle 50% of your data
- Excellent for spotting **outliers** (the dots outside the whiskers).
- Great for **comparing** distributions of different groups side-by-side.

**Quartiles** are points that divide your sorted data into four equal parts or quarters.

- **First Quartile (Q1):** The 25th percentile. This means 25% of your data is _below_ this value.
    
- **Second Quartile (Q2):** The 50th percentile. This is simply the **median** of your entire dataset.
    
- **Third Quartile (Q3):** The 75th percentile. This means 75% of your data is _below_ this value.
    

Quartiles are what make up the "box" in a box plot and are used to calculate the Interquartile Range (`IQR = Q3 - Q1`), which measures the spread of the middle 50% of your data.



## Histogram
histogram only applies with one variable and frequency

## Scatter plot
applies with 2 or more variables
