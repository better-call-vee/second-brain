A great way to structure your analysis for a portfolio project is the **STAR method**: **Situation**, **Task**, **Action**, and **Result**.

- **Situation:** Start by explaining the problem and the context. What is the business problem you're trying to solve? (e.g., "The mayor of SunnyVille is concerned about citizen complaints and wants to understand the key drivers of dissatisfaction.")
    
- **Task:** Clearly state your objective. What is your goal as the analyst? (e.g., "My task is to analyze the city's operational data to identify the main causes of complaints and suggest data-driven solutions.")
    
- **Action:** This is the main part of your project. Describe the steps you took. This is where you showcase all the charts we've built.
    
    - "First, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis**. A **heatmap** revealed a strong correlation between temperature and electricity usage."
        
    - "Next, I used **box plots** to compare complaints by district, discovering that Southtown had an unusual number of outliers."
        
    - "A **time series line plot** showed that complaints peak in the summer and winter months."
        
    - "Finally, a **geospatial map** pinpointed the exact neighborhoods with the most power cut issues."
        
- **Result:** Conclude with your findings and recommendations. What is the answer to the problem? (e.g., "The analysis shows that the primary issues are heat-related power cuts concentrated in Southtown. I recommend the city investigate the grid infrastructure in that specific area and prepare for peak usage during summer and winter.")
