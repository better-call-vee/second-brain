The mayor is worried about power cuts, traffic, and even an excess of ice cream carts. She's given you a messy file with all the data.

->
- **Relationship Question:** "Is there a connection between high temperatures and the number of 'Power Cut' complaints?" (This looks for a cause-and-effect relationship).
    
- **Comparison Question:** "Which district has the most 'Garbage' complaints, and does that same district also have the lowest average survey ratings?" (This compares categories to find patterns).
    
- **Distribution Question:** "Are 'Traffic' complaints spread evenly across all districts, or are they concentrated in one specific area like 'Downtown'?" (This explores the distribution of a problem).

- **Better EDA(EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS) Questions:** Move beyond "how often" to ask about **relationships**, **comparisons**, and **distributions** between different variables in your data.
    
- **Plotting Approaches:** Use the simple `plt` interface for quick, single plots. Use the more powerful **object-oriented (`fig, ax`)** interface when you need precise control, especially for creating figures with **multiple subplots**.
