- **Probability:** A number from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain) that measures the likelihood of an event. It's the foundation for making guesses from data.
    
- **Hypothesis Testing:** A formal way to test an idea using data. You compare a **Null Hypothesis** (H0​, no effect) with an **Alternative Hypothesis** (HA​, your idea).
    
- **p-value:** The probability of seeing your results if the null hypothesis were true.
    
    - **Low p-value (< 0.05):** Strong evidence. You **reject** the null hypothesis. Your result is **statistically significant**. This is usually what you're looking for!
        
    - **High p-value (> 0.05):** Weak evidence. You **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. The result is not significant.
    
- The more it goes up, the less I get chances to predict. It's the **probability of seeing your results if the null hypothesis (the boring reality) were true**.
