**Correlation (Finding Connections):**

- Measures the relationship between two **quantitative** variables.
    
- **Positive Correlation:** As one goes up, the other tends to go up (e.g., House Size & Price).
    
- **Negative Correlation:** As one goes up, the other tends to go down (e.g., Rainy Days & Ice Cream Sales).
    
- **Scatter Plots** let you _see_ the relationship.
    
- The **Correlation Coefficient (r)** gives you a number from -1 to +1 to _measure_ the relationship's strength and direction.
    
- **Golden Rule:** **Correlation â‰  Causation**. Always look for hidden factors (like hot weather causing both ice cream sales and shark attacks to rise).
