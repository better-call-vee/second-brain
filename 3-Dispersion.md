**Measuring the "Spread":**

- **Range:** Highest - Lowest. Simple but can be misleading.
    
- **Standard Deviation:** The most important measure of spread.
    
    - **Low SD:** Data is consistent and tightly clustered around the mean.
        
    - **High SD:** Data is spread out and unpredictable.
**In a normal distribution, what percentage of data lies within one standard deviation of the mean?**
68% at least
