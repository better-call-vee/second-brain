If there is an Outlier(a data point which is very far away from others), then we need median. 

- The **Mean** is heavily influenced by outliers. It gets pulled up by that one massive salary, giving a misleading picture of what a typical employee earns.
    
- The **Median** is resistant to outliers. It just looks at the middle value, so the CEO's salary doesn't affect it.


When I analyze data like **salaries, income, or house prices** - which often have extreme high value, the **%% median %%** is usually a more honest and reliable measure of the center than the mean.


`The Mode` is simply the value that appears most often. In our salary example, no value repeats, so there is no mode.

The mode is most useful for **qualitative** data. For example, if you were analyzing customer orders and the most frequent item purchased was "Chicken Biryani," that would be the mode. It tells you the most popular choice.



# MEAN > MEDIAN, right skewed
